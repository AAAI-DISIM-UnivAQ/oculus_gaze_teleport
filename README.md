# Oculus Gaze Teleport for Unity

This is a simple gaze-based movement system for Unity and Oculus. It supports a dynamic and adaptive spotlight to be used as a torch.

# Usage

1) Drag the OVRCameraRig prefab in your scene
2) Create a new tag in the Tag Manager and name it "Walkable"
3) If you want a collider to be a teleport target, just set its tag to "Walkable"
4) All the other colliders will be considered as invalid targets
5) Done!
